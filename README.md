# QR Scanner
_An app that scans a qr code for locations and websites._

# Funcionality ⚙️
_For this app I implement a SQLite database for the data persistence and I integrate the Google Maps API to show the results directly inside QR Scanner. For scanned urls, it will use the device's default browser._
_It's designed using material 3 and it was builded with Flutter._
